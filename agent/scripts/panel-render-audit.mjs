// Render the REAL panel bundle with a stubbed device API, and audit it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every earlier visual check in this repo was a hand-built HTML
// gallery: I wrote the markup, linked the stylesheet, and measured the elements I
// had just created. That verifies the CSS I was thinking about and nothing else —
// and it is how five chrome contrast defects lived through several rounds of
// "auditing": `#session-count`, `.side-time`, `.side-count`, `.tab.active` and
// `.view-switch-btn.active` were wrong the whole time and no feature-by-feature
// gallery could see them, because I only ever measured what I was working on.
//
// This harness instead loads `resources/panel/panel.js` and `panel.css` — the
// exact bytes the agent embeds via include_str! — into a page that serves at a
// real `/panel/` origin, with `window.fetch` stubbed to return a fixed device
// state. The app boots through its own production path (including computeBoot's
// same-origin branch) and renders its own component tree. Then it:
//
//   1. measures EVERY visible text node, alpha-compositing both background alpha
//      and the ancestor `opacity` chain (element opacity is in NEITHER
//      getComputedStyle(color) NOR backgroundColor — a probe that ignores it
//      reports a dimmed element at its full colour);
//   2. asserts each governance element is PRESENT, so a clean contrast sweep over
//      a page that failed to render cannot pass;
//   3. checks nothing in the top bar overflows.
//
// Pages are addressed over http://vale.test/panel/ and satisfied by Playwright
// route interception, so NO listener is opened anywhere — the run is safe on a box
// where binding a port is not allowed.
//
// Usage (needs the Playwright runtime; see VALE_BROWSER_HELPER):
//   node scripts/panel-render-audit.mjs --out /tmp/panel-audit
//
// Regenerate panel.js/panel.css first: (cd agent/resources/panel-react && npm run build)
